Description: Lightweight package which acts as a wrapper around mclapply and adds a progress bar to it in RStudio or Linux environments. Simply replace your original call to `mclapply()` with `pmclapply()`. Also includes functions to safely print messages (including error messages) from within parallelised code. This can be very useful for debugging parallel R code.
