Description: Lightweight package which acts as a wrapper around mclapply and adds a progress bar to it in RStudio or Linux environments. Simply replace your original call to `mclapply()` with `pmclapply()`. A progress bar can also be displayed with parallelisation via the 'foreach' package. Also included are functions to safely print messages (including error messages) from within parallelised code, which can be useful for debugging parallelised R code.
